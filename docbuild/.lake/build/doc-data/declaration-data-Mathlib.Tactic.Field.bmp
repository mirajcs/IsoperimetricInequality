For example:\n```\nexample {x y : ℚ} (hx : x + y ≠ 0) : x / (x + y) + y / (x + y) = 1 := by\n  field\nexample {a b : ℝ} (ha : a ≠ 0) : a / (a * b) - 1 / b = 0 := by field\n```\nThe scope of the tactic is equality goals which are *universal*, in the sense that they are true in\nany field in which the appropriate denominators don't vanish. (That is, they are consequences purely\nof the field axioms.)\n\nChecking the nonvanishing of the necessary denominators is done using a variety of tricks -- in\nparticular this part of the reasoning is non-universal, i.e. can be specific to the field at hand\n(order properties, explicit `≠ 0` hypotheses, `CharZero` if that is known, etc).  The user can also\nprovide additional terms to help with the nonzeroness proofs. For example:\n```\nexample {K : Type*} [Field K] (hK : ∀ x : K, x ^ 2 + 1 ≠ 0) (x : K) :\n    1 / (x ^ 2 + 1) + x ^ 2 / (x ^ 2 + 1) = 1 := by\n  field [hK]\n```\n\nThe `field` tactic is built from the tactics `field_simp` (which clears the denominators) and `ring`\n(which proves equality goals universally true in commutative (semi-)rings). If `field` fails to\nprove your goal, you may still be able to prove your goal by running the `field_simp` and `ring_nf`\nnormalizations in some order.  For example, this statement:\n```\nexample {a b : ℚ} (H : b + a ≠ 0) : a / (a + b) + b / (b + a) = 1\n```\nis not proved by `field` but is proved by `ring_nf at *; field`.
